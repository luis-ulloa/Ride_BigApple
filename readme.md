### Problem Statement

Can yellow cab fares be predicted within New York City's five boroughs based on time of the day, time of the year and certain high passenger areas?
The aim here is to use existing historical data of NYC cab rides spanning several years and building a model that can be integrated into a simple app to request a taxi ride and predict the expected fare and distance for the passenger.

### Datasets

The original <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction'>dataset</a> contains 55.4 million rows and eight columns. Given the vast size of this dataset, only 60 thousand rows were randomly sampled. This subset is labeled `nyc_taxidata_60k.csv`. The original eight columns, in order, are: `key`, `fare_amount`, `pickup_datetime`, `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`, `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude` and `passenger_count`.
After the data cleaning process was completed, the following datasets were generated and saved: `taxi_clean_set_v1.csv`, `taxi_clean_set_v2.csv`, `taxi_clean_set_v3.csv`.  The data dictionary below corresponds to the latest dataset, which contains 35 columns.

### Summary

Given the available data, predicting a yellow cab fare in NYC, as well as the estimated ride distance is possible. However, the final model yielded a RMSE of 3.60 dollars. At first glance, that's a good performance, but the base fare for a cab ride in NYC is 2.50 dollars, so trying to get the RMSE below that threshold is important since a very short ride may end up with a predicted fare that's below the base, or even negative.

### Recommendation

Version 2.0, which aims to improve RMSE should take into account the following:
* Going back to the EDA section to deeper explore identified relationships between features.
* For some of the engineered features, dissect the data into more granular form. For example, expanding weekend rides to include rides taking place on Fridays past noon (Friday has the highest rides), as well as start counting the holiday rides on Thanksgiving week rather than the whole month of November.
* Clustering: Ignore to a certain degree the silhouette scores and focus more on building smaller, localized pickup and dropoff clusters around local landmarks known to draw high passenger traffic, such as baseball stadiums, Madison Square Garden, Grand Central Station, Penn Station, Columbus Circle, Wall Street, Times Square, etc.
Exploring all these possibilities and employing more in-depth feature engineering, may help make version 2.0 even more accurate.
